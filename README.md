Integrate Solem Watering Bluetooth Controllers (only tested in BL-IP) into your Home Assistant. This Integration is meant to only provide services for Home Assistant to control irrigation using your BL-IP controller. 

This fork restores the verified BL-IP BLE opcodes, converts manual durations from minutes to seconds, and enables the required notification handshake before command writes.

## Installation

This integration can be added as a custom repository in HACS and from there you can install it.

When the integration is installed in HACS, you need to put on configuration.yaml:

```yaml
solem_toolkit:
```
Then you can restart Home Assistant and the services from Solem Toolkit will be available.

## Services

There is no configuration, you only need to use the provided services. They are self-explanatory:
* list_characteristics - List the services and its characteristics
* turn_off_permanent - Turn off the Sprinkler permanently
* turn_off_x_days - Turn off the Sprinkler for X days
* turn_on - Turn the Sprinkler on
* sprinkle_station_x_for_y_minutes - Sprinkle station X (number starting from 1) for Y minutes (integer)
* sprinkle_all_stations_for_y_minutes - Sprinkle all stations for Y minutes (integer)
* run_program_x - Run program X
* stop_manual_sprinkle - Stop the Sprinkler if it is sprinkling

## FAQ

### Can I configure the MAC address of the controller?

No, as this is 'just' a toolkit you need to provide it to every service. I plan to have a different Integration that will use this toolkit that will take care of that.
